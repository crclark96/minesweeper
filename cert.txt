EXP30-C: no modifications of variables between sequence points
         no errors or warnings generated with -Wsequence-point flag at 
         compile time

EXP32-C: no volatile access through non-volatile references
         no errors or warnings generated with -Wcast-qual flag at
         compile time

EXP33-C: do not access uninitialized memory
         no errors or warnings generated with -Wuninitialized flag at
         compile time

EXP34-C: do not dereference null pointers
         we ensure that proper board sizes are passed so no malloc'd memory returns null

EXP35-C: do not modify objects with a temporary lifetime
         all of our objects are permanent

EXP36-C: do not cast pointers into more strictly aligned pointer types
         all of our types are static and do not change throughout the program

EXP37-C: call functions with the correct number and type of arguments
         all of our function calls align with function definitions defined in
         header files

EXP39-C: do not access variables through pointers of incompatible types
         we do not make any type changes in our program

EXP40-C. Do not modify constant objects
         we used preprocessor #defines, and so there are no const objects we modified

EXP46-C: do not use bitwise operator with boolean-like operand
         no bitwise operators used in codebase

ARR30-C  do not form or use out-of-bounds pointers or array subscripts
         in code where we are indexing grid[][] or board[][] checks are 
         made to ensure that out-of-bound memory is not accessed
         
ARR32-C  ensure size areguments for variable length arrays are in a valid range
         the command line arguments for the game are verified to be within a 
         valid range, so that board[][] and grid[][] are valid arrays.
